# 🖼️ Image Classification Model

This project implements an **Image Classification** system that can automatically recognize and classify images into predefined categories. It uses deep learning techniques (like CNN) or machine learning algorithms depending on the dataset and objective.

---

## 📌 Objective

To train a model that takes an image as input and predicts its correct class label with high accuracy. This can be applied to tasks like:
- Handwritten digit recognition
- Animal or plant species classification
- Fashion or object detection
- Custom dataset classification

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using `TensorFlow` / `Keras` (or PyTorch)
- For basic models, traditional ML (SVM, KNN) with flattened features can also be used
- Example layers (if CNN):
  - Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
  - Flatten → Dense → Softmax

## ⚙️ Features

- Image preprocessing (resize, normalize)
- Data augmentation (optional)
- Train/test split
- Model training & evaluation
- Accuracy & loss visualization
- Save and load model
- Predict on new unseen images
